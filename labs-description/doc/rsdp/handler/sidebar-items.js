window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"struct":[["PhysicalMapping","Describes a physical mapping created by `AcpiHandler::map_physical_region` and unmapped by `AcpiHandler::unmap_physical_region`. The region mapped must be at least `size_of::<T>()` bytes, but may be bigger."]],"trait":[["AcpiHandler","An implementation of this trait must be provided to allow `acpi` to access platform-specific functionality, such as mapping regions of physical memory. You are free to implement these however you please, as long as they conform to the documentation of each function. The handler is stored in every `PhysicalMapping` so itâ€™s able to unmap itself when dropped, so this type needs to be something you can clone/move about freely (e.g. a reference, wrapper over `Rc`, marker struct, etc.)."]]};
